## **4. Alert Log**

The **Alert Log** is a critical diagnostic file in Oracle Database that provides essential insights into the health and functioning of the database instance.

---

### ✅ **What is an Alert Log?**

* The **alert log** contains important information about **internal errors**, **exceptions**, and **major database events** that occur during Oracle Database operations.
* It is a **chronological log file** automatically maintained by the database.
* Used to **monitor database health**, debug issues, and audit events.
* **Each Oracle Database instance** has **one alert log**.

---

### 📌 **What Kind of Information is Captured in the Alert Log?**

The alert log captures:

* Database **startup and shutdown** messages.
* **Log switches** (when redo logs switch from one group to another).
* **Checkpoint information**.
* **Tablespace and datafile operations** (e.g., adding or dropping a datafile).
* **Errors** (especially ORA-xxxx errors).
* **Deadlock** information.
* **Recovery operations** (manual or automatic).
* **RMAN backup messages** (in some cases).
* **Physical or logical structure changes** (like renaming a datafile or resizing a tablespace).

---

### 🧠 **Why Is It Important for DBAs?**

* Acts as the **first place to check** when troubleshooting.
* Helps identify **database performance issues**, **corruption**, or **unexpected events**.
* Important for **auditing system-level changes**.
* Monitored by **automated scripts** and tools like **OEM (Oracle Enterprise Manager)** for alerting.

### 🔍 **How to Find the Alert Log Location?**

#### ➤ For Oracle 12c and above:

```sql
SQL> SELECT value FROM v$diag_info WHERE name = 'Diag Trace';
```

* This query returns the **trace directory path**, where the alert log is located.

---

### 📁 **Sample Alert Log File Location:**

```bash
/u01/app/oracle/diag/rdbms/ORCL/ORCL/trace/alert_ORCL.log
```

* `diag` – Root ADR folder
* `rdbms` – Database-specific section
* `ORCL` – Database SID
* `trace` – Directory containing alert log and trace files

---

### 🔧 **How to View the Alert Log in Linux?**

Use the following commands to navigate and read the alert log:

```bash
$ cd /u01/app/oracle/diag/rdbms/ORCL/ORCL/trace/
$ vi alert_ORCL.log               # Opens in vi editor for full view
$ tail -50f alert_ORCL.log        # Shows last 50 lines and follows new entries live
```

* `tail -f` is useful to **monitor live activity** (e.g., during startup, shutdown, or log switches).

---

### 📊 **Important View Related to Alert Logs:**

#### ➤ `V$DIAG_INFO`

This view provides the **location details** of various ADR folders, including:

* `Diag Trace` – Path to the alert log and trace files.
* `Diag ADR Home` – Base ADR directory.
* `Health Monitor` – Location of health checker logs.

```sql
SELECT * FROM V$DIAG_INFO;
```

### 📝 **Best Practices for Alert Log Monitoring**

1. **Automate alert log scanning** using scripts (e.g., grep for `ORA-`).
2. Use **Enterprise Manager** or **custom shell scripts** to send email notifications.
3. Rotate or purge logs periodically in large environments.
4. Use **ADRCI** (ADR Command Interpreter) for advanced filtering and diagnostics.
